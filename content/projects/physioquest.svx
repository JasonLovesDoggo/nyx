# PhysioQuest

PhysioQuest is an innovative application that uses artificial intelligence to gamify physiotherapy exercises, encouraging consistent and accurate completion of prescribed routines.

The platform leverages computer vision technology to track patient movements and provide real-time feedback on exercise form and completion. By transforming rehabilitation exercises into engaging game-like activities, PhysioQuest aims to significantly boost adherence to prescribed physiotherapy routines, potentially enhancing rehabilitation outcomes for patients.

Built with Python, OpenCV for motion tracking, HTML and SCSS for the frontend interface, and Django for the backend framework, this project demonstrates the potential of technology to improve healthcare outcomes.

PhysioQuest was awarded first place at JamHacks 7, recognizing its innovative approach to solving a real-world healthcare challenge.
